#
# This is a Dockerfile to create a small runtime container image by 
# packaging the Micronaut app native executable as a “mostly static” 
# native image which statically links everything except libc. 
# Statically linking all your libraries except glibc ensures your 
# application has all the libraries it needs to run on any 
# Linux glibc-based distribution like "gcr.io/distroless/base". 
# The application runtime image size is only 82.5 MB.
#
